-   This app is an easy-to-use interface built in Streamlit that uses [KeyBERT](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) library from Maarten Grootendorst!
-   It uses a minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages multiple NLP embeddings and relies on `Transformers` from Hugging Face ü§ó to extract the most relevant keywords/keyphrases, that is to say, the terms in the text!
-   It also uses `Flair` to help adding a pipeline for the Roberta language model from HuggingFace.
-   And it also integrates `keyphrase-vectorizers` to automatically select the best approach regarding how many n-grams to include.
-   Finally, as a translator would suggest, it also has the option to save the terms in CSV.

There is no divine creator and therefore there is no plan for human beings. But what does this mean for love, which is so entwined with ideas of fate and destiny? Love must come from freedom, it must be blissful and mutual and a merging of freedom. But for Sartre, it isn't: love implies conflict. The problem occurs in the seeking of the lover's approval, one wants to be loved, wants the lover to see them as their best possible self. But in doing so one risks transforming into an object under the gaze of the lover, removing subjectivity and the ability to choose, becoming a "loved one". """,

In modern wind turbines, wind rotates the rotor blades, which convert kinetic energy into rotational energy.
