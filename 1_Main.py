    \n### Welcome to the place where I test my NLP apps ideas!
    \nYou will find some kind of magic, but it's a matter of believing or not. I do believe in the magic of computational linguistics and natural language processing.
    \nI'm sharing a few examples of how using Python and some available libraries and resources, a few things can be done. 
    I built this app using Streamlit, an open-source app framework built specifically for
    Machine Learning and Data Science projects. And of course, it includes many othe libraries like Spacy, NLTK, Transformers, Pandas, scikit-learn, Beautiful Soup, TextBlob, Gensim, PyTorch...
    \nEnjoy the ride! 	:bike:
