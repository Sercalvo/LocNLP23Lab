# NLP and Localization LAB
### Welcome to the place where I test my NLP ideas!
You will find some kind of magic, but it's a matter of believing or not. I do believe in the magic of computational linguistics and natural language processing.

I'm sharing a few examples of how using Python and some available libraries and resources, a few things can be done. I have built this app using `Streamlit`, an open-source app framework built specifically for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. Behind, there's a full range of libraries and Python code, of course. I am not an expert, but do take advantage of libraries like `Spacy`, `NLTK`, `Transformers`, `Pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `Beautiful Soup`, `TextBlob`, `Gensim`, `PyTorch` and many others!

The goal? Unveil the secrets of languages, no matter if they are meant for humans or computers. The main NLP applications that you will find in this web app are:

`Tokenization`, `Lemmatization`, `Embeddings and vectorization`, `Part of Speech and dependency analyzer`, `Feature extraction`, `Text generation`, `Sentiment analysis`, `Term extraction`

New ideas are often like waves returning all the time to embrace the shore. I will be in the beach waiting for the new wave. There is plenty of ideas to surf!
    
Enjoy the ride! 	:bike:
