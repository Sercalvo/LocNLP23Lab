    # NLP and Localization LAB
    \n**Welcome to the place where I test different NLP applications**
    \nYou will find some kind of magic. I'm sharing a few examples of how using Python and some available libraries and resources, a few things can be done. 
    I built this app using Streamlit, an open-source app framework built specifically for
    Machine Learning and Data Science projects.And of course, it includes many othe libraries like Spacy, NLTK, Transformers, Pandas, scikit-learn, Beautiful Soup, TextBlob, Gensim, PyTorch...
    \nEnjoy the ride!
